 * Concrete implementation of the {@link WeatherManager}.
 * This class handles the logic for random weather transitions based on turn counters.
 * It uses a pseudo-random number generator to determine:
 *    - When the weather changes.
 *    - Which new condition is selected.
 *    - Whether a shot misses due to bad weather conditions.
